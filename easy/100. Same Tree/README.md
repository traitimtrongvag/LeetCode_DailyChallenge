## Problem Description

Given the roots of two binary trees `p` and `q`, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

### Example
Example 1
**Input:** p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]

**Output:** true

### Example
Example 2
**Input:** p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]

**Output:** false

### Example
Example 3
**Input:** p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]

**Output:** false

### Constraints
- The number of nodes in both trees is in the range `[0, 100]`.

 - `-10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4`
