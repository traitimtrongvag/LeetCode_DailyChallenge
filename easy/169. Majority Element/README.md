# Problem 169: Majority Element

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topics:** Array, Hash Table, Divide and Conquer, Sorting, Counting

---

## Problem Description

Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return *the majority element*.

The majority element is the element that appears more than `⌊n / 2⌋` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

### Example
Example 1
**Input:** nums = [3,2,3]

**Output:** 3

### Example
Example 2
**Input:** nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]

**Output:** 2

### Constraints
- `n == nums.length`

 - `1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`

 - `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

 - The input is generated such that a majority element will exist in the array.

### Follow-up
Could you solve the problem in linear time and in `O(1)` space?
