# Problem 33: Search in Rotated Sorted Array

**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Topics:** Array, Binary Search

## Problem Description

There is an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with 
distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, `nums` is 
possibly left rotated at an unknown index `k` (`1 

### Example
Example 2
**Input:** nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3

**Output:** -1

### Example
Example 3
**Input:** nums = [1], target = 0

**Output:** -1

### Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`

 - `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`

 - All values of `nums` are 
unique.

 - `nums` is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.

 - `-10^4 <= target <= 10^4`
