# Problem 4230: Longest Arithmetic Sequence After Changing At Most One Element

**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Topics:** Array, Enumeration

---

## Problem Description

You are given an integer array `nums`.

A subarray is 
arithmetic if the difference between consecutive elements in the subarray is constant.

You can replace 
at most one element in `nums` with any 
integer. Then, you select an arithmetic subarray from `nums`.

Return an integer denoting the 
maximum length of the arithmetic subarray you can select.

 

### Example
Example 1
**Input:** nums = [9,7,5,10,1]

**Output:**
5

**Explanation:** - Replace `nums[3] = 10` with 3. The array becomes `[9, 7, 5, 3, 1]`.

 - Select the subarray `[

9, 7, 5, 3, 1
]`, which is arithmetic because consecutive elements have a common difference of -2.

### Example
Example 2
**Input:** nums = [1,2,6,7]

**Output:**
3

**Explanation:** - Replace `nums[0] = 1` with -2. The array becomes `[-2, 2, 6, 7]`.

 - Select the subarray `[

-2, 2, 6
, 7]`, which is arithmetic because consecutive elements have a common difference of 4.

 

### Constraints
- `4 <= nums.length <= 10^5`

 - `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
