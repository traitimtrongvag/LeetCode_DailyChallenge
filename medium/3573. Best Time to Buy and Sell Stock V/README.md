## Problem Description

You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a stock in dollars on the `i^th` day, and an integer `k`.

You are allowed to make at most `k` transactions, where each transaction can be either of the following
 - 

Normal transaction: Buy on day `i`, then sell on a later day `j` where `i 

**Input:** prices = [1,7,9,8,2], k = 2

**Output:** 14

**Explanation:** We can make $14 of profit through 2 transactions
 - A normal transaction: buy the stock on day 0 for $1 then sell it on day 2 for $9.

 - A short selling transaction: sell the stock on day 3 for $8 then buy back on day 4 for $2.

### Example
Example 2
**Input:** prices = [12,16,19,19,8,1,19,13,9], k = 3

**Output:** 36

**Explanation:** We can make $36 of profit through 3 transactions
 - A normal transaction: buy the stock on day 0 for $12 then sell it on day 2 for $19.

 - A short selling transaction: sell the stock on day 3 for $19 then buy back on day 4 for $8.

 - A normal transaction: buy the stock on day 5 for $1 then sell it on day 6 for $19.

### Constraints
- `2 <= prices.length <= 10^3`

 - `1 <= prices[i] <= 10^9`

 - `1 <= k <= prices.length / 2`
